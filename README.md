# SpellCheckerUsingTrie
A c++ spell checker program using Trie Data Structure.

Trie is a tree-based data structure, which is used for efficient retrieval of a key in a large data-set of strings. Unlike a binary 
search tree, where node in the tree stores the key associated with that node, in trie nodeâ€™s position in the tree defines the key with 
which it is associated and the key are only associated with the leaves. It is also known as prefix tree as all descendants of a node have 
a common prefix of the string associated with that node, and the root is associated with the empty string.
